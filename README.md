# Image_Captioning_with_Resnet
OpenCV: For basic image processing tasks. Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation and processing. NLTK/Spacy: For text preprocessing
(tokenization, lemmatization, etc.). PyTorch: For building and training the model. ResNet
(ResNet50/ResNet101): A pre-trained ResNet model for feature extraction
from images. LSTM/GRU: For sequence modeling in caption generatio
